=== Detailed Description
Creates a new branch using an existing branch or commit SHA in an existing GitLab project using a
user's private token (obtained in GitLab under the intended user's 'Settings' => 'Account'). The
source location for the new branch is found through providing the projects path (which is the
project name provided in the URL - not necessarily the same as the readable name) and an existing
branch or commit SHA. Once this is found, the new branch will be created with the given name and
the previously found source. An empty result set will be returned on a successful branch creation.
