=== Detailed Description
Creates a new project in the given GitLab instance using a user's private token (obtained in GitLab
under the intended user's 'Settings' => 'Account') and information about the new project. If the
new project should be placed under an existing group, the handler first has to do a search to
retrieve the id for a group matching the inputted path. A POST object is then created using the
name/path (at least one is required to be provided), the group id (if a group was provdied), as well
as any of the remaining input parameters. If any errors are caught on the creation attempt they will
be caught and raised along with the error code and message. If there are no errors, an id for the
newly created project will be returned.
