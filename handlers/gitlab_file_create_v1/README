=== Detailed Description
Creates a new file in an existing GitLab project and branch using a user's private token (obtained
in GitLab under the inteded user's 'Settings' => 'Account') and the location, name, and contents of
the file that should be added. The project the file should be added to is found through providing
the projects path (which is the project name provided in the URL - not necessarily the same as the
readable name) and the project group (if it is in something other than the default group). The file
and the location it should be placed at is built based upon the branch, folder, file name, and file
contents parameters. If the branch provided doesn't currently exist, it will be created upon
successful addition of the file. An empty result set will be returned on successful file creation.
