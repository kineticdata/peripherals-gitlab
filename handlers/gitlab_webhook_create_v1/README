=== Detailed Description
Creates a new webhook using a user's private token (obtained in GitLab under the intended user's
'Settings' => 'Account') and the new webhook information. The URL and Secret Token are values that
are used to build and send the request when a GitLab action fires the webhook (a secret token is not
required) while trigger events determine when the webhook is triggered. For more information on
configuring webhooks in GitLab, see GitLab's general webhook documentation
(https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/integrations/webhooks). If the webhook is successfully created,
the newly created webhook id will be returned in the results.
